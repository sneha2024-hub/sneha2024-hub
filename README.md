### 💫 About Me:

🔭 I’m currently building hands-on data analysis projects using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python to strengthen my analytics skills.

👯 I’m open to collaborating on beginner-friendly analytics projects, dashboards, and data storytelling initiatives.

🤝 I’m seeking mentorship and feedback on SQL optimization, Python (Pandas), and project structuring for real-world use cases.

🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Excel, SQL, Power BI, Python (Pandas, NumPy), and core Statistics for Data Analysis.

💬 Ask me about data cleaning, EDA, dashboard design, and how to start in Data Analytics as a fresher.
